\f0\fs24 \cf0 The first long homework or calories. Is programs about calculation the calories per day and if your calories are too much the programs will tall you how much time that you need to do exercise, so I completed all function  that the program need but have confused in the main code a litter bit  because in function take_order() the return output have change position. Therefore, it make the output in main code have not correct position, so I solve this problem by use \'93 = \'93  to configure the variable to be in a correct position.}
